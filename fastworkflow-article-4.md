*This is the final article in our four-part series on building AI agents with fastWorkflow. [Read Part 3 here](./fastworkflow-article-3.md) if you haven't already.*

In our previous articles, we've progressed from simple function-based commands to stateful classes and inheritance hierarchies. Now, we're ready to tackle the most powerful feature of `fastWorkflow`: complex context hierarchies with bidirectional navigation.

Real-world applications rarely have flat structures. Instead, they consist of nested objects with complex relationships. A user belongs to a chatroom, a document belongs to a project, an order belongs to a customer. In this article, we'll explore how `fastWorkflow` enables your AI agent to navigate these relationships naturally, moving up and down the object hierarchy just as a human would.

## Why Context Hierarchies Matter for AI Agents

Before diving into the code, let's understand why context hierarchies are so important for building sophisticated AI agents:

1. **Natural Navigation**: Users naturally think in terms of hierarchies and want to navigate between contexts ("go back to the chatroom").
2. **Contextual Commands**: Different commands make sense in different contexts, but should be accessible from related contexts.
3. **Shared Resources**: Child objects often need access to resources or state from their parent objects.
4. **Bidirectional Relationships**: Navigation should work both ways - from parent to child and from child to parent.
5. **Complex Workflows**: Real applications involve workflows that span multiple related objects.

Let's see how `fastWorkflow` makes it easy to model these relationships and create an intuitive command structure that mirrors your application's object hierarchy.

## From Inheritance to Context Hierarchies

We'll enhance our messaging app from the previous article to support a full chatroom with multiple users. Specifically, we'll:

1. Create a `ChatRoom` class that can contain multiple `User` objects
2. Define parent-child relationships between `ChatRoom` and `User`
3. Enable navigation between contexts (from user to chatroom and back)
4. Add commands for managing users and broadcasting messages
5. Implement advanced features like database validation for parameter extraction

Let's start by comparing the application code between the two versions.

### Step 1: Enhance the Application Code with Parent-Child Relationships

In our previous example, we had a simple `User` and `PremiumUser` hierarchy:

```python
# messaging_app_3/application/user.py
class User:
    """Simple user class representing the current messaging user."""

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

    def send_message(self, to: str, message: str):
        """Send a message to the target user (prints to stdout)."""
        print(f"{self.name} sends '{message}' to {to}") 

class PremiumUser(User):
    def send_priority_message(self, to, message):
        print(f"{self.name} sends PRIORITY message '{message}' to {to}")
```

Now, we'll modify the `User` class to have a reference to its parent `ChatRoom` and add a new `ChatRoom` class:

```python
# messaging_app_4/application/user.py
from __future__ import annotations

# Avoid a runtime circular import: only import ChatRoom when running type checks
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:  # pragma: no cover â€“ only needed for static type checkers
    from .chatroom import ChatRoom

class User:
    """Simple user class representing the current messaging user."""

    def __init__(self, chatroom: "ChatRoom", name: str):
        self.chatroom = chatroom
        self.name = name

    def send_message(self, to: str, message: str):
        """Send a message to the target user (prints to stdout)."""
        print(f"{self.name} sends '{message}' to {to}") 

class PremiumUser(User):
    def send_priority_message(self, to, message):
        print(f"{self.name} sends PRIORITY message '{message}' to {to}")
```

```python
# messaging_app_4/application/chatroom.py
from .user import User, PremiumUser


class ChatRoom:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_user = None
        self.users = []

    def add_user(self, user: User):
        self.users.append(user)

    def list_users(self) -> list[str]:
        return [user.name for user in self.users]

    @property
    def current_user(self) -> User:
        return self._current_user

    @current_user.setter
    def current_user(self, value: User):
        self._current_user = value

    def broadcast(self, message) -> None:
        sender_name = self._current_user.name if self._current_user else 'Anonymous'
        msg_priority = 'PRIORITY' if isinstance(self._current_user, PremiumUser) else ''

        if self.users:
            for user in self.users:
                if user.name == sender_name:
                    continue
                print(f"user {sender_name} is broadcasting {msg_priority} '{message}' to {user.name}")
        else:
            print("No users found in this chat room. Add some users first")
```

**Key differences:**
- `User` now has a reference to its parent `ChatRoom`
- We've added a new `ChatRoom` class that manages a collection of users
- `ChatRoom` has methods for adding users, listing users, and broadcasting messages
- `ChatRoom` tracks the current active user
- We've used TYPE_CHECKING to avoid circular imports, a common pattern in complex object hierarchies

### Step 2: Define the Context Hierarchy Model

In our previous example, we only had an inheritance model. Now, we need to define the parent-child relationships between contexts:

```json
# messaging_app_4/context_hierarchy_model.json
{
    "User": {
      "parent": [
        "ChatRoom"
      ]
    },
    "PremiumUser": {
      "parent": [
        "ChatRoom"
      ]
    }
}
```

**Key points:**
- This JSON file defines the parent-child relationships between command contexts
- `"User": { "parent": ["ChatRoom"] }` means that a `User` has a `ChatRoom` as its parent
- `"PremiumUser": { "parent": ["ChatRoom"] }` means that a `PremiumUser` also has a `ChatRoom` as its parent
- This tells `fastWorkflow` how to navigate up the context hierarchy

### Step 3: Implement the Context Navigation Classes

To enable context navigation, we need to add special `_Context.py` files in each command directory:

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/User/_User.py
from ...application.chatroom import ChatRoom
from ...application.user import User

class Context:
    @classmethod
    def get_parent(cls, command_context_object: User) -> ChatRoom:
        return command_context_object.chatroom
```

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/PremiumUser/_PremiumUser.py
from ...application.chatroom import ChatRoom
from ...application.user import PremiumUser

class Context:
    @classmethod
    def get_parent(cls, command_context_object: PremiumUser) -> ChatRoom:
        return command_context_object.chatroom 
```

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/ChatRoom/_ChatRoom.py
from ...application.chatroom import ChatRoom


class Context:
    @classmethod
    def get_parent(cls, command_context_object: ChatRoom) -> None:
        return None
```

**Key points:**
- Each context class has a special file named `_<ClassName>.py`
- These files define how to navigate from one context to another
- The `get_parent` method returns the parent object for a given context object
- For `User` and `PremiumUser`, the parent is the `chatroom` attribute
- For `ChatRoom`, there is no parent (it's the root of our hierarchy)

### Step 4: Update the Root Context Initialization

Instead of initializing a `User` as the root context, we now initialize a `ChatRoom`:

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/set_root_context.py
import fastworkflow

from ..application.chatroom import ChatRoom


class ResponseGenerator:
    """Create a User instance and attach it as the root command context."""

    def __call__(
        self,
        workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow,
        command: str
    ) -> fastworkflow.CommandOutput:
        # Initialize the root command context
        workflow.root_command_context = ChatRoom()

        response = (
            f"Now you can call commands exposed in this context."
        )

        return fastworkflow.CommandOutput(
            workflow_id=workflow.id,
            command_responses=[
                fastworkflow.CommandResponse(response=response)
            ]
        )
```

**Key differences:**
- We've renamed the file from `initialize_user.py` to `set_root_context.py`
- We're creating a `ChatRoom` instance as the root context
- We've simplified the command to take no parameters
- This sets up the initial context hierarchy

### Step 5: Add ChatRoom Commands

Now we need to add commands that operate on the `ChatRoom` context:

#### Add User Command

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/ChatRoom/add_user.py
import fastworkflow
from fastworkflow.train.generate_synthetic import generate_diverse_utterances
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from ...application.chatroom import ChatRoom
from ...application.user import User, PremiumUser

class Signature:
    class Input(BaseModel):
        user_name: str = Field(
            description="Name of a person",
            examples=['John', 'Jane Doe'],
            min_length=3,
            max_length=20
        )
        is_premium_user: bool = Field(
            description="Whether this is a premium user",
        )

    class Output(BaseModel):
        user_added: bool = Field(
            description="Whether the user was added",
        )

    plain_utterances = [
        "Add Fred to our list of users",
        "Update the chatroom with new premium user John Smith",
        "We have a new regular user Mary Jane",
    ]

    @staticmethod
    def generate_utterances(workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, command_name: str) -> list[str]:
        """This function will be called by the framework to generate utterances for training"""
        return [
            command_name.split('/')[-1].lower().replace('_', ' ')
        ] + generate_diverse_utterances(Signature.plain_utterances, command_name)


class ResponseGenerator:
    """Call the User.send_message instance method."""

    def _process_command(self, workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, input: Signature.Input) -> Signature.Output:
        chatroom: ChatRoom = workflow.command_context_for_response_generation

        if input.user_name in chatroom.list_users():
            return Signature.Output(user_added=False)

        chatroom.add_user(
            PremiumUser(chatroom, input.user_name) 
            if input.is_premium_user else
            User(chatroom, input.user_name)
        )

        return Signature.Output(user_added=True)

    def __call__(self, workflow: 
                 fastworkflow.Workflow, 
                 command: str, 
                 command_parameters: Signature.Input) -> fastworkflow.CommandOutput:
        """The framework will call this function to process the command"""
        output = self._process_command(workflow, command_parameters)
        
        response = (
            f'Response: {output.model_dump_json()}'
        )

        return fastworkflow.CommandOutput(
            workflow_id=workflow.id,
            command_responses=[
                fastworkflow.CommandResponse(response=response)
            ]
        )
```

#### Set Current User Command with Database Validation

```python
# messaging_app_4/_commands/ChatRoom/set_current_user.py
from typing import Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

import fastworkflow
from fastworkflow.train.generate_synthetic import generate_diverse_utterances
from fastworkflow.utils.signatures import DatabaseValidator

from ...application.chatroom import ChatRoom

class Signature:
    class Input(BaseModel):
        user_name: str = Field(
            description="Name of a person",
            examples=['John', 'Jane Doe'],
            json_schema_extra={'db_lookup': True}
        )

    class Output(BaseModel):
        user_found: bool = Field(
            description="Whether we found the user",
        )

    plain_utterances = [
        "Set Fred as the current user",
    ]

    @staticmethod
    def db_lookup(workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, 
                  field_name: str, 
                  field_value: str
                  ) -> tuple[bool, str | None, list[str]]:
        if field_name == 'user_name':
            chatroom: ChatRoom = workflow.command_context_for_response_generation
            key_values = chatroom.list_users()
            matched, corrected_value, field_value_suggestions = DatabaseValidator.fuzzy_match(field_value, key_values)
            return (matched, corrected_value, field_value_suggestions)
        return (False, '', [])

    @staticmethod
    def generate_utterances(workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, command_name: str) -> list[str]:
        """This function will be called by the framework to generate utterances for training"""
        return [
            command_name.split('/')[-1].lower().replace('_', ' ')
        ] + generate_diverse_utterances(Signature.plain_utterances, command_name)


class ResponseGenerator:
    """Call the User.send_message instance method."""

    def _process_command(self, workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, input: Signature.Input) -> Signature.Output:
        chatroom: ChatRoom = workflow.command_context_for_response_generation

        if input.user_name not in chatroom.list_users():
            return Signature.Output(user_found=False)

        for user in chatroom.users:
            if user.name == input.user_name:
                break

        chatroom.current_user = user

        # lets change the current context to this user
        workflow.current_command_context = user

        return Signature.Output(user_found=True)

    def __call__(self, workflow: 
                 fastworkflow.Workflow, 
                 command: str, 
                 command_parameters: Signature.Input) -> fastworkflow.CommandOutput:
        """The framework will call this function to process the command"""
        output = self._process_command(workflow, command_parameters)
        
        response = (
            f'Response: {output.model_dump_json()}'
        )

        return fastworkflow.CommandOutput(
            workflow_id=workflow.id,
            command_responses=[
                fastworkflow.CommandResponse(response=response)
            ]
        )
```

**Key features:**
1. **Database Validation**: The `db_lookup` method provides real-time validation of user input against the current list of users
2. **Context Switching**: The `set_current_user` command changes the current context from `ChatRoom` to `User`
3. **Structured Output**: Commands return structured data using Pydantic models
4. **Fuzzy Matching**: The `DatabaseValidator.fuzzy_match` method helps correct typos in user names

### Step 6: Add a Startup Action

To make our workflow more user-friendly, we'll add a startup action that initializes the root context automatically:

```json
# messaging_app_4/startup_action.json
{
    "command_name": "set_root_context",
    "command": "",
    "parameters": {}
}
```

**Key points:**
- This JSON file defines an action to run when the workflow starts
- It calls the `set_root_context` command with no parameters
- This ensures the ChatRoom is initialized before the user starts interacting

## Running the Context Hierarchy Workflow

To run our context hierarchy workflow, we follow the same steps as before, but now we can use the `--startup_action` flag:

```sh
# Train the workflow
fastworkflow train ./messaging_app_4 ./messaging_app_4/fastworkflow.env ./messaging_app_4/fastworkflow.passwords.env

# Run the workflow with the startup action
fastworkflow run ./messaging_app_4 ./messaging_app_4/fastworkflow.env ./messaging_app_4/fastworkflow.passwords.env --startup_action ./messaging_app_4/startup_action.json
```

Let's walk through a typical interaction with our new workflow:

```
# The workflow starts with the ChatRoom context due to our startup action
Context: ChatRoom
Command: set_root_context
Now you can call commands exposed in this context.

User > add user Alice who is a regular user
Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/add_user
Command parameters: Input(user_name='Alice', is_premium_user=False)
Response: {"user_added":true}

User > add user Bob who is a premium user
Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/add_user
Command parameters: Input(user_name='Bob', is_premium_user=True)
Response: {"user_added":true}

User > list users
Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/list_users
Response: {"users":["Alice","Bob"]}

User > set current user to Alice
Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/set_current_user
Command parameters: Input(user_name='Alice')
Response: {"user_found":true}

# Notice how the context has changed from ChatRoom to User
User > tell bob@example.com hello from Alice
Context: User
Command: User/send_message
Command parameters: Input(to='bob@example.com', message='hello from Alice')
Response: The message was printed to the screen

# Let's navigate back to the parent context
User > go back to chatroom
Context: User
Command: navigate_to_parent
Response: Successfully navigated to parent context ChatRoom

User > set current user to Bob
Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/set_current_user
Command parameters: Input(user_name='Bob')
Response: {"user_found":true}

User > send priority message to alice@example.com with urgent update
Context: PremiumUser
Command: PremiumUser/send_priority_message
Command parameters: Input(to='alice@example.com', message='urgent update')
Response: The message was printed to the screen

User > broadcast message to all users that lunch is ready
Context: PremiumUser
Command: navigate_to_parent
Response: Successfully navigated to parent context ChatRoom

Context: ChatRoom
Command: ChatRoom/broadcast_message
Command parameters: Input(message='lunch is ready')
Response: Message has been broadcast
```

Behind the scenes, you'll see the console output:
```
Alice sends 'hello from Alice' to bob@example.com
Bob sends PRIORITY message 'urgent update' to alice@example.com
user Bob is broadcasting PRIORITY 'lunch is ready' to Alice
```

Notice how we can navigate between contexts:
1. We start in the `ChatRoom` context
2. We set the current user to Alice, which changes the context to `User`
3. We navigate back to the parent context (`ChatRoom`)
4. We set the current user to Bob, which changes the context to `PremiumUser`
5. We navigate back to the parent context again to broadcast a message

This natural navigation between contexts mirrors how users think about the application structure.

## Advanced Features in Context Hierarchies

Our example demonstrates several advanced features of `fastWorkflow` that are essential for building sophisticated AI agents:

### 1. Database Validation and Fuzzy Matching

The `set_current_user` command uses database validation to ensure the user exists:

```python
@staticmethod
def db_lookup(workflow: fastworkflow.Workflow, 
              field_name: str, 
              field_value: str
              ) -> tuple[bool, str | None, list[str]]:
    if field_name == 'user_name':
        chatroom: ChatRoom = workflow.command_context_for_response_generation
        key_values = chatroom.list_users()
        matched, corrected_value, field_value_suggestions = DatabaseValidator.fuzzy_match(field_value, key_values)
        return (matched, corrected_value, field_value_suggestions)
    return (False, '', [])
```

This enables:
- **Real-time validation** of user input against the current state
- **Fuzzy matching** to handle typos or partial matches
- **Suggestions** when the exact match isn't found

### 2. Bidirectional Context Navigation

Our workflow supports navigation in both directions:
- **Downward**: From `ChatRoom` to `User` or `PremiumUser` using `set_current_user`
- **Upward**: From `User` or `PremiumUser` back to `ChatRoom` using `navigate_to_parent`

This bidirectional navigation is defined through:
- The `context_hierarchy_model.json` file
- The `_<ClassName>.py` files with `get_parent` methods

### 3. Structured Inputs and Outputs

Commands use Pydantic models for both inputs and outputs:

```python
class Input(BaseModel):
    user_name: str = Field(
        description="Name of a person",
        examples=['John', 'Jane Doe'],
        json_schema_extra={'db_lookup': True}
    )

class Output(BaseModel):
    user_found: bool = Field(
        description="Whether we found the user",
    )
```

This provides:
- **Type safety** for all parameters
- **Validation** of inputs before command execution
- **Structured responses** that can be easily processed
- **Self-documenting** API with descriptions and examples

### 4. Context-Aware Command Routing

Commands are automatically routed to the appropriate context:
- Commands in `ChatRoom/` are available in the `ChatRoom` context
- Commands in `User/` are available in the `User` context
- Commands in `PremiumUser/` are available in the `PremiumUser` context

The framework automatically handles:
- Finding commands in the current context
- Finding commands in parent contexts when needed
- Respecting inheritance relationships

## Building Real-World Applications with Context Hierarchies

With context hierarchies, you can now build truly sophisticated AI agents that mirror the structure of your application:

- **Document Management**: Navigate between projects, folders, documents, and sections
- **E-commerce**: Move between customers, orders, products, and reviews
- **CRM Systems**: Navigate between accounts, contacts, opportunities, and activities
- **Development Tools**: Switch between projects, files, functions, and tests
- **Healthcare Systems**: Navigate between patients, visits, treatments, and prescriptions

The possibilities are endless. By modeling your application's natural structure as a context hierarchy, you create an AI agent that users can interact with intuitively, using the same mental model they already have for your application.

## What's Next? Building Your Own Workflows
